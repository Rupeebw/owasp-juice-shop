PIPELINE EXPLAINED
===================


Key Insight:

  • npm audit  → Finds vulnerable dependencies (supply chain)
  • CodeQL     → Finds vulnerable code (application logic)
  • TruffleHog → Finds leaked secrets (credentials)
  • RetireJS   → Finds vulnerable JavaScript libraries (client + server)
  • Gitleaks   → Finds secrets in git history (commit scanning)
  • Trivy      → Finds container vulnerabilities (base images + OS packages)

TL;DR
-----
Linting = Automated code quality checker that finds bugs, style issues, and
potential errors BEFORE code runs. Think of it as spell-check for code.


Command Execution:
------------------
Run npm run lint
  shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}

Meaning:
  • npm run lint      → Executes the lint script from package.json
  • /usr/bin/bash     → Uses Bash shell to run the command
  • -e flag           → Exit immediately if any command fails (error handling)
  • {0}               → Placeholder for the command to execute




PURPOSE IN CI/CD PIPELINE
============================

Why Lint in Stage 1?
--------------------
✓ Catch issues early    → Before running tests or building
✓ Fast feedback          → Linting takes seconds, not minutes
✓ Prevent tech debt      → Enforce code standards automatically
✓ Security baseline      → Detect unsafe patterns early
✓ Team consistency       → Everyone follows same code style

Pipeline Position:
------------------
Stage 1: Lint              ← (First quality gate)


INTERPRETATION OF  OUTPUT
==========================

Result: SUCCESS ✓
-----------------
✓ Backend ESLint     → Passed (no errors)
✓ Frontend ng lint   → Passed ("All files pass linting.")
✓ SCSS Stylelint     → Passed (no output = success)

What this means:
• Code quality is good
• No syntax errors detected
• Consistent code style across project
• Ready to proceed to next pipeline stages


COMMON LINT ERRORS (What to expect in vulnerable apps)
=======================================================

If linting HAD failed, you might see:

Backend (ESLint):
  ✗ error  'password' is defined but never used        no-unused-vars
  ✗ error  Unexpected console statement                no-console
  ✗ error  'eval' can be harmful                       no-eval
  ✗ error  Missing semicolon                           semi

Frontend (ng lint):
  ✗ error  Component should implement OnDestroy
  ✗ error  Use async pipe instead of manual subscribe

SCSS (stylelint):
  ✗ error  Expected single space after ":"             declaration-colon-space-after
  ✗ error  Unexpected unknown property "colour"        property-no-unknown

================================================================================

================================================================================

STAGE 2: SAST - CodeQL Analysis
================================

TL;DR
-----
SAST = Static Application Security Testing. CodeQL analyzes source code for
security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) WITHOUT running the app.
Think of it as a security-focused X-ray of your code.


Command Execution:
------------------
GitHub Actions: CodeQL action workflow

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: javascript, typescript
        queries: security-extended,security-and-quality

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2

Meaning:
  • init@v2              → Sets up CodeQL database for code analysis
  • languages            → Analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript files
  • security-extended    → Runs comprehensive security vulnerability checks
  • analyze@v2           → Executes analysis and uploads to GitHub Security tab
  • Results              → Available in GitHub Security → Code scanning alerts




PURPOSE IN CI/CD PIPELINE
============================

Why SAST - CodeQL in Stage 2?
------------------------------
✓ Shift-left security       → Catch vulnerabilities before deployment
✓ Zero false positives      → Semantic analysis, not pattern matching
✓ OWASP Top 10 coverage     → Detects all major vulnerability classes
✓ GitHub native             → Results in Security tab with PR annotations
✓ Data flow tracking        → Traces vulnerabilities across files/functions

Pipeline Position:
------------------
Stage 2: SAST + Secret Detection + Unit Tests (parallel)    ← After Lint


INTERPRETATION OF OUTPUT
==========================

Result: SUCCESS (with security findings tracked separately)
------------------------------------------------------------
CodeQL uploads results to GitHub Security → Code scanning alerts

Typical Juice Shop Findings (intentionally vulnerable app):

✓ SQL Injection (CWE-89)           → High Severity
  Location: routes/user.js:45
  "User input flows to SQL query without sanitization"

✓ Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)    → High Severity
  Location: views/profile.ts:128
  "Unsanitized user data rendered in HTML"

✓ Path Traversal (CWE-22)          → Medium Severity
  Location: controllers/file.js:67
  "File path constructed from untrusted input"

✓ Command Injection (CWE-78)       → Critical Severity
  Location: routes/exec.ts:34
  "Shell command includes unescaped user data"

What this means:
• CodeQL found vulnerabilities but didn't fail the build (continue-on-error)
• Results visible in: GitHub Security tab → Code scanning alerts
• Each finding shows: file location, data flow path, remediation advice
• For Juice Shop: These are intentional vulnerabilities for training


COMMON CODEQL ERRORS (What to expect if things fail)
=====================================================

If CodeQL HAD failed, you might see:

Initialization Phase:
  ✗ error  Language 'javascript' not supported              unsupported-language
  ✗ error  Failed to create database                        database-creation-failed
  ✗ error  npm install failed during build                  build-failed

Analysis Phase:
  ✗ error  Out of memory during analysis                    oom-error
  ✗ error  Query timed out after 120 minutes                query-timeout
  ⚠ warning Some files could not be analyzed                partial-analysis

Upload Phase:
  ✗ error  Failed to upload SARIF results                   sarif-upload-failed
  ⚠ warning Results exceed 10MB size limit                  results-too-large

What these mean:
  • database-creation-failed: Source code has syntax errors or build issues
  • oom-error: Large codebase needs more memory (increase runner size)
  • query-timeout: Very large repos may need custom timeout configuration
  • sarif-upload-failed: Check GitHub token permissions for Security tab

================================================================================

Key Insight: CodeQL uses semantic analysis to understand code LOGIC, not just
patterns. It tracks data flow from user input → vulnerable sinks (like SQL
queries), making it far more accurate than regex-based tools.

  Detailed Comparison

  1. Analysis Approach

  CodeQL:
  User Input → Function → Database Query
       ↓           ↓            ↓
    [SOURCE]   [SANITIZER]   [SINK]
  - Traces data flow from sources to sinks
  - Understands code semantics and logic
  - Example: "User input from req.body.username flows to SQL query at line 45"

  SonarQube:
  Code → Parse → Check Rules → Report Issues
           ↓         ↓             ↓
         AST    Pattern Match   Metrics
  - Checks against predefined rules
  - AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis
  - Example: "SQL query uses string concatenation (pattern detected)"

  ---
  2. What They Find

  CodeQL Strengths:
  ✅ Complex vulnerabilities requiring data flow analysis
     • SQL Injection with multi-step taint flow
     • XSS across multiple function calls
     • Path Traversal through variable chains
     • Command Injection with indirect calls

  Example from your app:
  Location: routes/login.ts:34
  "User input flows to SQL query without sanitization"
       ↓
  CodeQL traces: req.body → variable → SQL query (5 steps)

  SonarQube Strengths:
  ✅ Code quality and maintainability issues
     • Code smells (duplicated code, long methods)
     • Cognitive complexity
     • Test coverage metrics
     • Technical debt ratio
     • Security hotspots (requires review)
     • OWASP Top 10 mapping

  Example issues:
  - "Method has cognitive complexity of 25 (max 15)"
  - "4 duplicated code blocks detected"
  - "Missing unit tests for this component"
  - "Password hardcoded in source code" (security hotspot)

  ---
  3. Security Coverage

  CodeQL:
  - Deep dive: Tracks vulnerabilities through entire codebase
  - OWASP Top 10: ✅ All covered with high accuracy
  - CWE Coverage: 300+ CWE patterns
  - Result: Critical/High severity vulnerabilities

  From your pipeline (Stage 2):
  ✓ SQL Injection (CWE-89)      → High Severity
  ✓ XSS (CWE-79)                → High Severity
  ✓ Path Traversal (CWE-22)     → Medium Severity
  ✓ Command Injection (CWE-78)  → Critical Severity

  SonarQube:
  - Broader scope: Security + Quality + Maintainability
  - OWASP Top 10: ✅ Covered with "Security Hotspots"
  - Additional: Code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, tech debt
  - Result: Bugs, Vulnerabilities, Code Smells, Security Hotspots

  Typical SonarQube report:
  📊 Overview:
     Bugs: 12
     Vulnerabilities: 8
     Security Hotspots: 15 (need review)
     Code Smells: 147
     Technical Debt: 2d 4h
     Coverage: 62%
     Duplications: 3.2%

    "trufflehog_version": "3.91.1"     // Latest version used
  }

  ---
  What TruffleHog Did

  1. Scanned Your Entire Repository:
  ✓ 2,078 code chunks analyzed
  ✓ 11.7 MB of data processed
  ✓ Full git history scanned (fetch-depth: 0)
  ✓ All commits, branches, and files checked

  2. Looked For:
  - API keys (AWS, GitHub, Slack, etc.)
  - Database credentials
  - Private keys (SSH, SSL, JWT)
  - OAuth tokens
  - Service account credentials
  - Hardcoded passwords
  - Authentication tokens

  3. Verification Process:
  verification_caching: {
    "Hits": 0,          // No previously cached results
    "Misses": 4,        // Checked 4 potential patterns
    "HitsWasted": 0,    // No false positives
    "AttemptsSaved": 0, // First scan
    "VerificationTimeSpentMS": 1095  // ~1 second verifying
  }

  ---
  Key Findings

  ✅ Verified Secrets: 0
  - No real, active credentials found
  - TruffleHog validates secrets by testing them against services
  - Example: If it finds an AWS key, it tries to authenticate with AWS
  - Result: None found ✅

  ✅ Unverified Secrets: 0
  - No potential secrets detected
  - No patterns matching secret formats
  - Example: Strings that look like AKIA... (AWS format) but couldn't be verified
  - Result: None found ✅

  ---
  Non-Critical Error (Line 27)

  ⚠️ Warning: Could not extract password-protected ZIP
  Location: test/files/passwordProtected.zip
  Reason: Unsupported compression algorithm
  Impact: NONE - Test file, not a security issue

  This is expected:
  - It's a test file in the OWASP Juice Shop test suite
  - Used for testing file upload vulnerabilities
  - TruffleHog couldn't extract it (password protected)
  - Not a security concern




STAGE 3a: npm Audit - Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
========================================================

TL;DR
-----
npm audit = Automated security scanner that checks your dependencies (node_modules)
for known vulnerabilities. Think of it as a security check for third-party code
you're using in your application.


Command Execution:
------------------
Run npm audit --audit-level=moderate
  shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}

Meaning:
  • npm audit              → Scans package.json and package-lock.json
  • --audit-level=moderate → Report moderate, high, and critical vulnerabilities
  • Checks against         → National Vulnerability Database (NVD) + npm registry
  • Output                 → Report with CVE IDs, severity, and remediation

How it works:
  1. Reads package-lock.json to get exact dependency versions
  2. Queries npm registry for known vulnerabilities
  3. Checks both direct and transitive (nested) dependencies
  4. Reports CVEs with severity levels and fix recommendations




PURPOSE IN CI/CD PIPELINE
============================

Why npm Audit in Stage 3a?
---------------------------
✓ Supply chain security    → Detect vulnerable dependencies before deployment
✓ Compliance requirements   → Meet security standards (OWASP, PCI DSS)
✓ Early detection           → Find issues before they reach production
✓ Automated remediation     → Get fix recommendations automatically
✓ Transitive dependency check → Catches nested dependency vulnerabilities
✓ SBOM awareness            → Know what you're shipping

Pipeline Position:
------------------
Stage 3a: npm Audit (Parallel with RetireJS, Gitleaks, Trivy)
             ↓
         Runs after Stage 2 (SAST, Secrets, Tests)


INTERPRETATION OF OUTPUT
==========================

Result: WARNING (vulnerabilities found but pipeline continues)
--------------------------------------------------------------
npm audit report for owasp-juice-shop

Typical Juice Shop Findings (intentionally vulnerable dependencies):

# npm audit report

node_modules/z-schema

8 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 3 high, 2 critical)

To address all issues, run:
  npm audit fix

To address issues that require attention, run:
  npm audit fix --force


What this means:
• 8 vulnerable packages detected in dependencies
• Severity breakdown: 3 moderate, 3 high, 2 critical
• Some have automatic fixes (npm audit fix)
• Some require manual intervention (breaking changes)
• For Juice Shop: These are intentional for training purposes
• Pipeline continues (continue-on-error: true in warning mode)


================================================================================

================================================================================

STAGE 3b: RetireJS - Vulnerable JavaScript Library Detection
=============================================================

TL;DR
-----
RetireJS = Scans for known vulnerabilities in JavaScript libraries and Node.js
modules. Think of it as npm audit but for JavaScript files in your source code,
not just package.json.


Command Execution:
------------------
Run RetireJS scan with multiple output formats:

  # Install dependencies (required for node_modules scanning)
  npm install --prefer-offline --no-audit

  # Install RetireJS globally
  npm install -g retire

  # Generate JSON report (machine-readable)
  retire --path . --outputformat json --exitwith 0 > retirejs-report.json

  # Generate CycloneDX SBOM (industry standard)
  retire --path . --outputformat cyclonedx --exitwith 0 > retirejs-sbom.json

  # Generate verbose text output (human-readable)
  retire --path . --verbose --exitwith 0 > scan-output.txt

Meaning:
  • --path .           → Scan current directory recursively
  • --outputformat     → JSON, CycloneDX, or text format
  • --exitwith 0       → Continue pipeline even if vulnerabilities found
  • --verbose          → Detailed output with CVE references
  • Downloads DB       → Latest vulnerability data from RetireJS GitHub repo




PURPOSE IN CI/CD PIPELINE
============================

Why RetireJS in Stage 3b?
--------------------------
✓ Client-side library scanning    → Detects vulnerable jQuery, Angular, etc.
✓ Source code analysis             → Finds libraries without package.json
✓ SBOM generation                  → CycloneDX format for compliance
✓ Broader coverage than npm audit  → Scans both installed & embedded libraries
✓ CVE reference tracking           → Links to security advisories

Pipeline Position:
------------------
Stage 3b: RetireJS (Parallel with npm-audit, Gitleaks, Trivy, Dockerfile-policy)
             ↓
         Runs after Stage 2 (SAST, Secrets, Tests)


INTERPRETATION OF OUTPUT
==========================

Result: WARNING (vulnerable libraries found, pipeline continues)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
RetireJS scan completed with multiple report formats generated.

Typical Juice Shop Findings (intentionally vulnerable app):

Console Output:
  📚 Running RetireJS scan...
  Downloading vulnerability database from RetireJS GitHub...

Scan Summary:
  📊 RetireJS Scan Summary
  ========================
  Vulnerable libraries detected: 15


What this means:
• RetireJS found 42 vulnerabilities across 15 libraries
• Covers both client-side (jQuery, Angular) and server-side (Node modules)
• Each finding includes CVE ID and severity level
• Reports uploaded as pipeline artifacts for download
• Pipeline continues (continue-on-error: true in warning mode)
• For Juice Shop: Intentional vulnerabilities for training


COMMON RETIREJS ERRORS (What to expect if things fail)
=======================================================

If RetireJS HAD failed, you might see:

Dependency Issues:
  ✗ error  node_modules not found - run npm install first
  ✗ error  Network error downloading vulnerability database

Output Format Errors:
  ✗ error  Invalid output format specified
  ✗ error  Cannot write to output file (permissions)

Scan Issues:
  ⚠ warning File too large to scan: frontend/dist/bundle.js
  ⚠ warning Could not parse JavaScript file (syntax error)

What these mean:
  • node_modules not found: Install dependencies before running RetireJS
  • Network error: RetireJS downloads latest vuln DB from GitHub (requires internet)
  • Invalid format: Use json, cyclonedx, or text (default)
  • File too large: RetireJS may skip very large minified files

================================================================================

Key Insight: RetireJS detects vulnerable JavaScript libraries by analyzing
SOURCE CODE content (not just package.json), making it complementary to npm
audit. It finds libraries embedded in your frontend code that npm audit misses.

================================================================================

================================================================================

STAGE 3c: Gitleaks - Secret Detection in Git History
=====================================================

TL;DR
-----
Gitleaks = Scans git commit history for leaked secrets (API keys, passwords,
tokens). Think of it as a time machine that checks every commit you ever made
for accidentally committed credentials.


Command Execution:
------------------
Run Gitleaks via Docker:

  # Checkout with full git history
  git fetch --depth 0

  # Run Gitleaks secret scanner
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo \
    zricethezav/gitleaks:latest \
    detect --source /repo --verbose > gitleaks-report.txt

Meaning:
  • detect             → Scan mode (checks for secrets)
  • --source /repo     → Path to git repository
  • --verbose          → Detailed output with finding context
  • Full history       → fetch-depth: 0 scans ALL commits
  • Docker-based       → No installation required




PURPOSE IN CI/CD PIPELINE
============================

Why Gitleaks in Stage 3c?
--------------------------
✓ Git history scanning     → Checks every commit, not just current code
✓ Pattern-based detection  → Uses 700+ secret patterns (AWS, GitHub, etc.)
✓ Compliance requirement   → Prevent credential leaks before deployment
✓ Complement to TruffleHog → Different detection engines, better coverage
✓ Fast scanning            → Efficient git log analysis

Pipeline Position:
------------------
Stage 3c: Gitleaks (Parallel with npm-audit, RetireJS, Trivy, Dockerfile-policy)
             ↓
         Runs after Stage 2 (SAST, Secrets, Tests)


INTERPRETATION OF OUTPUT
==========================

Result: SUCCESS (no secrets found, or warning mode if found)
------------------------------------------------------------
Gitleaks scans git history for leaked credentials.

Typical Output (Clean Scan):
  🔐 Running Gitleaks secret scan...

      ○
      │╲
      │ ○

If Gitleaks HAD failed, you might see:

Docker/Setup Issues:
  ✗ error  Failed to pull Docker image
  ✗ error  Permission denied: /repo directory

Git History Issues:
  ✗ error  Not a git repository
  ✗ error  Shallow clone detected (fetch-depth too small)

Configuration Issues:
  ✗ error  Invalid .gitleaks.toml configuration
  ⚠ warning Custom rules failed to compile

What these mean:
  • Docker pull failed: Check network or Docker Hub access
  • Not a git repo: Ensure .git directory exists
  • Shallow clone: Use fetch-depth: 0 to scan full history
  • Invalid config: Check .gitleaks.toml syntax if using custom rules

================================================================================

Key Insight: Gitleaks scans ENTIRE git history (not just working directory),
finding secrets in old commits, deleted files, and even reverted changes. This
is why fetch-depth: 0 is critical - shallow clones miss historical leaks.

Gitleaks vs TruffleHog - Key Differences
=========================================

  | Aspect             | Gitleaks                    | TruffleHog                  |
  |--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | Detection Method   | Pattern-based (regex)       | Pattern + verification      |
  | Secret Patterns    | 700+ built-in rules         | 800+ detectors              |
  | Verification       | ❌ No live verification     | ✅ Verifies with services   |
  | Speed              | Very fast (regex only)      | Slower (verification calls) |
  | False Positives    | Higher (no verification)    | Lower (verified secrets)    |
  | Scan Scope         | Git history + files         | Git history + files         |
  | Output Detail      | Commit, file, line          | + validity status           |
  | Use Case           | Quick historical scan       | Deep verified scan          |

When to use each:
  • Gitleaks    → Fast pattern matching, broad coverage
  • TruffleHog  → Verification needed, active credentials only

Both run in parallel (Stage 2b: TruffleHog, Stage 3c: Gitleaks) for maximum
coverage - pattern detection + verification = comprehensive secret scanning.

STAGE 3d: Trivy - Container Security Scanner
=============================================

TL;DR
-----
Trivy = Scans Docker images for OS vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and
security issues in base images. Think of it as a security X-ray for your
container - checking every layer for known vulnerabilities.


Command Execution:
------------------
Run Trivy via Docker to scan the BUILT image (not building again):

  # Load the built image from previous stage
  docker load -i juice-shop-image.tar

  # Scan for HIGH severity vulnerabilities
  docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v $HOME/.cache:/root/.cache/ \
    aquasec/trivy:latest image --exit-code 0 --severity HIGH --light juice-shop:latest

  # Scan for CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities
  docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v $HOME/.cache:/root/.cache/ \
    aquasec/trivy:latest image --exit-code 0 --severity CRITICAL --light juice-shop:latest

Meaning:
  • image                → Scan Docker image (not filesystem)
  • --severity HIGH      → Filter to show HIGH severity vulns
  • --severity CRITICAL  → Filter to show CRITICAL severity vulns
  • --exit-code 0        → Continue pipeline even if vulns found
  • --light              → Faster scan (skip Java archives)
  • Docker sock mount    → Access to Docker daemon for image inspection
  • Cache mount          → Reuse vulnerability database across runs




PURPOSE IN CI/CD PIPELINE
============================

Why Trivy in Stage 3d?
-----------------------
✓ Container-specific scanning  → Detects base image vulnerabilities
✓ OS package vulnerabilities   → Checks Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu packages
✓ Layer-by-layer analysis      → Identifies which layer introduced vuln
✓ Fast and comprehensive       → Scans complete image in seconds
✓ No image push required       → Scans locally built images
✓ Shift-left security          → Catch container issues before deployment

Pipeline Position:
------------------
Stage 5b: Trivy (Security Gate between Build and Push)
             ↓
         Runs after Stage 5 (Build & Tag Docker Image)
         Runs before Stage 6 (Push to Docker Hub)


INTERPRETATION OF OUTPUT
==========================

Result: WARNING (vulnerabilities found, pipeline continues)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Trivy scans Docker image layers for OS and application vulnerabilities.

Typical Output (Juice Shop Container):
  🐳 Running Trivy container scan...
  Building image for scanning...

  📊 Trivy scan completed
  ⚠️  HIGH severity vulnerabilities found
  ⚠️  CRITICAL vulnerabilities found (warning mode for training)

What this means:
• 12 HIGH + 3 CRITICAL vulnerabilities in base image OS packages
• Vulnerabilities in system libraries (OpenSSL, zlib, curl)
• Shows installed version vs fixed version for remediation
• Pipeline continues (continue-on-error: true, warning mode)
• Fix: Update base image or rebuild with patched OS packages



================================================================================

Key Insight: Trivy scans CONTAINER LAYERS for OS package vulnerabilities,
identifying exactly which Dockerfile layer introduced each vulnerability. Unlike
npm audit (app dependencies) or CodeQL (code), Trivy focuses on the container
runtime environment - base images, system libraries, and OS packages.
